![rick and morty portal](./images/rick-and-morty-portal-shoes-white-clothing-zavvi-23.png)

- ### What was done? :thinking:

Using the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and its [documentation](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest) to obtain character data from the Rick and Morty series together with the [Axios library](https://axios-http.com/ptbr/docs/intro) to consume the API, a web application was made to list the characters.

- ### Established rules: ::page_with_curl::

#### The character list must have:

- Basic information for each
character (name, status and species);
- The image of each character;
- Pagination.
